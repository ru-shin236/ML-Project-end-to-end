# End to End Machine Learning Project

### About

- This an sample machine learning end to end project.
- Data can be found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/student-performance-in-mathematics).
- This project is based on regression problem statment.
- Models are evaluated and selected based on best r2_score.
- No model will be selected if the r2_score is less then 60.
- Used logging and CustomException for backtracing error and raising exceptions.
- Build a web app using flask for data input and pridiction.

### Agenda of the project

- To predict maths score of a student based on the following attributes.
- As the target variable is continuous and numeric we will be building regression model.
- Model Evaluation based on r2_score.
- Selecting the best model based on r2_score.
- Using it in flask web app to do prediction.

### Dataset description:

- This data conssist of following columns and there meaning:

  - Gender: The gender of the student (male/female)

  - Race/ethnicity: The student's racial or ethnic background (Asian, African-American, Hispanic, etc.)

  - Parental level of education: The highest level of education attained by the student's parent(s) or guardian(s)

  - Lunch: Whether the student receives free or reduced-price lunch (yes/no)

  - Test preparation course: Whether the student completed a test preparation course (yes/no)

  - Math score: The student's score on a standardized mathematics test

  - Reading score: The student's score on a standardized reading test

  - Writing score: The student's score on a standardized writing test
